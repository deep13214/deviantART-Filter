## Permissions
These are the required browser permissions for DeviantArt Filter.

If you would like to know more about permissions in general, Mozilla has a [support article about permissions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions) on permissions, as well as a [guide for assessing the safety of an extension](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tips-assessing-safety-extension).

Please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/new) if you are still concerned about the use of any of the following permissions so the information provided below can be updated to cover common concerns and answer common questions.
