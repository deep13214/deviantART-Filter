## Usage

### Hiding Users While Browsing
1. When you see a deviation from someone you want to hide, hover over the thumbnail image
2. In the top-left corner, an `x` icon will appear
3. Click on the `x` to hide all deviations from that user
4. You can click that `x` again to un-hide that user later

### Hiding Known/Specific Users
If you know the username of a user you want to filter, you can manually enter their username without actually finding one of their deviations.
1. Click the `Manage Filters` link that appears in the top right corner of [deviantART](https://www.deviantart.com)
    - It is beside your username, by the Message Center icon, when you are logged in
    - It is beside the Join and Login links when you are not logged in
2. Enter their username in the field at the top of the `Filtered Users` tab
    - **IMPORTANT**: usernames should be entered in all lowercase letters, even if their username is not displayed that way
3. Click the `Hide User` button next to the field

### Placeholders vs Completely Hiding Deviations
deviantART Filter normally displays a blank "placeholder" image for each filtered user. This is intended to allow you to see that the filters are actually working, as well as to provide a quick way to un-hide users. However, these placeholder images can be disabled, resulting in all filtered users being completed hidden when browsing [deviantART](https://www.deviantart.com).
1. Click the `Manage Filters` link that appears in the top right corner of [deviantART](https://www.deviantart.com)
    - It is beside your username, by the Message Center icon, when you are logged in
    - It is beside the Join and Login links when you are not logged in
2. View the `Settings` tab
3. Uncheck the `Use placeholders for hidden deviations` option at the top of the Settings tab

### Exporting/Importing Filters
deviantART Filter allows your to export and import filters. This is mostly for keeping your filters in sync between browsers/computers, but is handy for backup purposes as well.
1. Click the `Manage Filters` link that appears in the top right corner of [deviantART](https://www.deviantart.com)
    - When you are logged in, it is located next to your username
    - When you are not logged in, it is located next to the Join and Login links
2. View the `Settings` tab
3. Scroll down to the `Export/Import Filters` section
3. To export existing filters:
    1. Click the `Export Filters` button to generate a text block in the large text box below the buttons
    2. Copy the entire block of text to your clipboard, then save it (i.e. in a plain text file) or import it elsewhere
4. To import new filters:
    1. Paste a previously exported text block into the large text box below the buttons
    2. Click the `Import Filters` button
        - The import results will be displayed, showing how many filters were imported
